# wp-gallery
This CSS creates responsive columns for WordPress' native gallery feature and can be added via a CSS plugin.
This allows a 3-column WP gallery to switch to 2 columns or 1 depending on the screen size. 
Itâ€™s basically a matter of resetting the item
widths (an item in a 3 column view gets 33% by default) and removing a
break.
